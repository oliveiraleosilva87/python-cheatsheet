<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project

This is the repository for my personal Python cheatsheet. I'll be adding content according with my learnings, by doing courses and building sample codes. Here you can:

* See a little of my Python capabilities
* Check the cheatsheet and find something useful
* Clone the repo just to make a quick search in the sample code

This is not the main tool in my current job, I'm trying to develop it in my free time.



### Built With

I mainly use Pycharm, but also Github Codespaces and Replit to save some keystrokes with their AI assistant

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You can see the raw code here in Github or clone this repository


### Prerequisites

You will need a Python interpreter to run the code, or paste the code in a cloud environment, like Replit


### Installation

It depends on which Python interpreter you may use. By using a cloud environment, it won't need anything to be installed

You could also clone the repository and use any text search tool (Sublime Text, Notepad++) to quickly find something in the cheatsheet
